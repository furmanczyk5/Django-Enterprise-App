    <h1>Micro Placemaking with Macro Results: Designing DC's First Semi-Permanent Parklet</h1>
    <p><strong> October 15, 2015</strong></p>
    <p>In July, D.C.'s first seasonal parklet popped up along K Street's busy commercial district. Transforming two parking spots into a playful, interactive micro-park, it invites pedestrians and office workers into a small oasis with fern and liatris.</p>
    <p>Called "<em>parKIT</em>," this new public space was designed by Gensler in collaboration with the Golden Triangle BID, as a toolkit for D.C.'s parklets. Wedge-shaped, multi-use modules of various heights can be scattered and rearranged by the public, and the scene at the parklet has been ever-changing since its opening.</p>
    <p>In this presentation, the <em>parKIT</em> team discussed the lessons learned from the design process, various reactions, and discoveries through the daily operation of the parklet. Also, they shared their observations on how temporary urban spaces can generate a new type of participation and placemaking in D.C.</p>
