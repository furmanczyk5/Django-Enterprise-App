        <h2>Houston, We Have a Plan</h2>
        <p>It's a project decades in the making, but now Houston — a city of more than 2.2 million people — finally has its first general plan.</p>
        <p>Houston's city council approved the plan in September, after its planning department, consultants, and various committees worked for more than a year assembling the document that outlines the city's goals and some of the steps needed to achieve them.</p>
        <p>Advocates for the plan say it's desperately needed as Houston goes through a period of unprecedented growth and development. "In all honesty, we should have had this plan 40 or 50 years ago," says Carol Lewis, a member of the plan's steering committee and director of the Center for Transportation Training &amp; Research at Texas Southern University. "We're decades behind."</p>
        <p>The city first took a stab at a general plan in the 1920s, but that effort also included a proposed zoning ordinance that proved too controversial in a city that famously eschews zoning, says Patrick Walsh, the city's planning director.</p>
        <p>A slew of factors came together to finally allow the latest attempt at a general plan, dubbed <em>Plan Houston</em>, to move forward. Local nonprofit Blueprint Houston spent more than a decade advocating for a plan. Mayor Annise Parker threw her support behind the effort too. But it's the area's rapid growth that advocates say tipped the scales in favor of a plan. The Houston-Galveston region's population is expected to increase from 5.8 million in 2010 to 9.6 million in 2040.</p>
        <p>Historically, Houston has been so big and so sprawling that it could afford to avoid long-term planning. But that's changing. "There's more pressure inward on existing redevelopment opportunities, and that requires another level of coordination," says Rebecca Leonard, AICP, a partner at Design Workshop and a consultant on <em>Plan Houston</em>.</p>
        <p><em>Plan Houston</em> lists 12 "core strategies" — things like the need to "foster an affordable city" and "sustain quality infrastructure." Beyond that it includes 32 "goals," and 95 "actions" to achieve them. One of its major themes is the need for more equity.</p>
        <p><img src="//placehold.it/400x200" width="375" alt=""></p>
        <p>Still, the plan is short on specifics: The whole document comes in at just 28 pages, seven of which are acknowledgments. That's led to some criticism that the general plan may be too general and fails to outline exactly how the city should address its challenges. "In my reading of the plan, it is not clear what the concrete steps may be," says Lester King, AICP, a research fellow at Rice University's Shell Center for Sustainability.</p>
        <p>The city's planning officials are well aware of that criticism but emphasize the document is only a first step in a broader process. Walsh says that <em>Plan Houston</em>'s steering committee made a deliberate choice to create a high-level plan in order to get political support, and realistically, a more detailed plan couldn't be assembled in just one year anyway. "The idea was to create a document that provides real guidance ... but also is flexible," Walsh says.</p>
        <p>Susan Alleman, a member of the Houston Planning Commission, notes that the document could be used as a tool to guide city departments' work in the future. "If it becomes part of the process in the city, implementation will follow," says Alleman, principal at the transportation planning and engineering firm Traffic Engineers, Inc.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Walsh hopes to have a draft of an annual work plan that provides concrete details about implementation available for review in February.</p>

        <h2>News Briefs</h2>
        <p>Ohio voters struck down a November ballot measure that would have made it the fifth state in the U.S. and the first in the Midwest to legalize recreational marijuana. One of the measure's provisions would have limited cultivation to 10 sites across the state — which some said was tantamount to a monopoly — but it is unclear if that's why it failed or if there was low support for legalization in general.</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Voters in Texas approved a ballot measure that will increase the state's transportation funding without raising taxes or implementing new fee-based roadways. The new legislation will pull an estimated $2.5 billion over 10 years from the general sales tax (starting in 2017) and the new vehicle sales tax (in 2019).</p>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>An increasing number of foreign-born people call Texas home. According to a new report from the Texas state demographer, one in six of the state's residents were born in a foreign country, and they account for more than 10 percent of the foreign-born population countrywide. Interestingly, Texas wasn't the first stop for all immigrants there: Nearly 40 percent of them moved to the state from elsewhere in the U.S.</p>

        <p>In November, Divvy, Chicago's bike-share program, teamed up with car sharing company Zipcar to provide bundle pricing when new and existing members sign up for both services. Eighty-five percent of Chicago Zipcar locations are within a block or two of a Divvy station.</p>

    <h2>A New Era of Wildfires</h2>
    <p>The 2003 Wedge Canyon fire missed Molly Shepherd's North Fork, Montana, property by a quarter mile. From her cabin deck, she watched flames lick down the mountainside through acres of pine and larch forest toward her home. The fire burned for more than two months, consuming seven homes and over 53,000 acres.</p>
    <p>As wildfire rages across the West again this year, officials who deal with fire say there are ways to protect people and property in an era of bigger, more dangerous fires. Homeowners can remove trees and brush from around buildings, and landowners can thin trees on their land. Counties can make sure roads in and out of communities are wide and safe.</p>
    <p>The problem is too few government officials and residents are taking those steps. And some of the larger projects on public land are controversial.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the risks are growing. The six worst fire seasons of the past 55 years occurred in the last 15, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Fire seasons are more than two months longer than they were in the 1970s. Forests across the West are dense, dry, stressed by climate change, and plagued by the mountain pine beetle.</p>
    <p>At the same time, people are moving into forested areas. In northwestern Montana, as the timber industry crumbles and the local economy shifts toward tourism and recreation, land that used to host sawmills now hosts subdivisions full of second homes.</p>
    <p>"We know that we have an extreme challenge ahead of us," says Bob Harrington, Montana's state forester.</p>
    <p>To reduce fire risk, state and federal land managers want to remove some trees from forested public land. That may mean cutting down dead or dying trees or flammable species to protect a watershed or a community. It may mean prescribed burns that use fire to clear out areas.</p>
    <p>"We want the forests to look something closer to what they looked like historically," Washington state forester Aaron Everett says. But some environmentalists oppose so-called "fuel reduction" projects. A Kalispell, Montana-area nonprofit called the Swan View Coalition has repeatedly sued to stop the U.S. Forest Service from logging.</p>
    <p><strong>Creating fire-adapted communities</strong></p>
    <p>North Fork is an isolated community of about 400 landowners wedged between Flathead National Forest and Glacier National Park.</p>
    <p>Since 2003, Shepherd has cleared an emergency exit route off her 80-acre property, continues her practice of weeding out fire-prone undergrowth, and has reclad her cabin with metal exterior. When she built a house on her property, she used fire-resistant concrete, a metal, and glass.</p>
    <p>In the western U.S., it's unusual for a state or a county to require home owners to build with fire-resistant materials or to thin trees on their land. California has a special building code for communities close to forests, as do some counties, such as Colorado's Boulder County.</p>
    <p>"The fact is, Montanans are reluctant to zone," says state Rep. Ed Lieser, a Democrat who serves on a state committee that oversees environmental issues. Montana's Department of Labor and Industry is about to release a zoning code for new construction in areas close to forest lands, but it's up to counties whether they adopt it, he says.</p>
    <p>Swope, Harrington, and Montana lawmakers all say the same thing: When the smoke from this year's fires clears, residents and policy makers lose their motivation to prepare for next year. It's a rare community group, like North Fork's committee, that can keep people focused on fire preparedness season after season and year after year.</p>

    <h2>EB-5 Funding in Flux</h2>
    <p>The Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation is one of those powerful pseudo-public agencies that mean a lot to those in the know — politicians and powerful business people — but exists outside the ken of the vast majority of city residents. So it's fitting that this institution is instrumental in managing the EB-5 program, a little-known means for foreign nationals to win visas if they invest between $500,000 and $1 million in a commercial development project that creates at least 10 jobs.</p>
    <p>That program is in the news lately. Congress passed a funding bill in September that allows continued funding of the Regional Centers portion of the program — a provision that allows the pooling of EB-5 capital — through December 11. After that date, its future is uncertain.</p>
    <p>The EB-5 program was established in 1990, but was seldom used until the Great Recession mangled normal capital flows. A 2015 report from New York University's Stern School notes that the number of visa applications jumped from 1,258 in 2008 to 10,928 during 2014. In fact, in 2005 the Government Accountability Office issued a report that found only 6,024 visas had been permitted during the first 14 years of the program, even though 10,000 are allowed annually.</p>
    <p>Many of those scant early visas were put to work by the PIDC. In 2003, it partnered with CanAm Enterprises LLC to create the PIDC Regional Center (the program includes a stipulation that commercial projects can be eligible if they create "indirect" jobs as long as the effort is sponsored by a Regional Center).</p>
    <p>Since then many of the major development projects that PIDC has coordinated — such as the successful redevelopment of Philadelphia's Navy Yard — have used EB-5 funds. Other projects receiving EB-5 funding include the city's convention center and the conversion of several vacant but historically significant downtown office buildings into hotels.</p>
    <p>But critics see the EB-5 program as a scattershot approach to economic development. Others consider it a gross abuse that allows wealthy immigrants to purchase visas; still others say that the regional centers approach that was supposed to benefit needy rural and urban areas has instead funded glitzy megaprojects. There have also been notable scandals in locations as disparate as South Dakota and Seattle, one of the other early adopters of the program.</p>
    <p>Even though Philadelphia's EB-5 track record seems scandal-free, the projects it has funded have a checkered track record. The hotel renaissance and the Navy Yard have received broad acclaim, but the convention center's sprawling, nearly windowless design grossly scars Center City.</p>
    <p>But the upcoming EB-5 ventures look far more promising. The funds are being put toward modernizing the fare system of the regional transit agency, SEPTA. Although such reform is desperately needed — Philadelphia is the only city that still uses tokens on mass transit — until recently state funds were not available. EB-5 helped get the process started.</p>
    <p>With its future unknown, PIDC, for one, hopes it will continue providing funds for years to come.</p>
    <p>"We think it is a very difficult program to run because you have to marry immigration with finance," Sam Rhoads, PIDC's executive vice president. "But cutting back on the program [as some in Congress have suggested] would make it a significant challenge to operate efficiently."</p>
