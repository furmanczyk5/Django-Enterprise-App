  <p>The final course in the <a href="http://www.nationaldevelopmentcouncil.org/index.php/site/training_schedule/category/certification/#edfp" target="_blank">EDFP Certification Program™</a>, ED300 integrates the business credit and real estate finance skills learned in previous courses with the creative demands of deal structuring. Participants apply a process for solving problems in order to overcome the myriad obstacles—economic, financial, political, social—to the successful structuring of business finance and real estate projects. The emphasis of this course is casework. Participants are challenged by case studies that involve complex financial issues such as workouts, business buyouts and tax credits in real estate projects. For Certified Planners, an understanding of problem solving and deal structuring skills and techniques for economic development projects, both business and real estate development, is critical to preparing and evaluating the action and implementation components of comprehensive city and neighborhood plans.&nbsp;<a href="https://register.asapconnected.com/CourseDetail.aspx?CourseId=23209" target="_blank">Learn more</a></p>
