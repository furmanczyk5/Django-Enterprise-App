            <p><h3>Planning Advisory Board Data Release Statement</h3>
The American Planning Association (APA) and its institute, the American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP), reserve the right, as owners of the data collected in relation to the AICP qualification exam, to analyze the results of each cycle of AICP qualification exams. Furthermore, APA and AICP reserve the right to provide observational exam data (e.g. demographic or employment information in the aggregate) to the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planners (ACSP and the Planning Accreditation Board (PAB), so that they may conduct their own analysis to better inform the education and accreditation decision-making.  However, APA and AICP will not use personal identification information in their analysis of AICP exam results data, nor will they provide personal identification information to ACSP or PAB to support those organizations’ analysis of AICP exam result data. Such personal identification information includes applicants’ email addresses, mailing addresses, or telephone numbers. APA will share specific application data with the applicants’ school for purposes of accreditation only.
