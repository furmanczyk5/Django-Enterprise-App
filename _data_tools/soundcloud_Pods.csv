He coined the term in 2010 to identify a range of housing types that provide more dwelling units than a single-family home but fewer than a midrise apartment building. These missing middle housing types—duplexes, fourplexes, cottage courts, and more—increase density while still keeping with the scale and character of a neighborhood. His firm, Opticos Design, helps communities implement form-based coding to allow for these structures.</p><p>Dan shares the firm's ideas and work with host Courtney Kashima, AICP, including a project in South Bend, Indiana, that tackles the issue of one neighborhood's 500 vacant lots and how to build on them. He stresses the need for a foundation of physical design within planning—without turning planners into designers. Courtney and Dan also explore his career path: He started as an architect but quickly realized he wanted to earn a graduate degree in urban design. After being told by several firms that he needed to choose one discipline or the other, he founded Opticos—a creative maneuver that allowed him the freedom to work on his dual passions.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmissingmiddlehousing.com%2F&amp;token=139049-1-1559851749964"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://missingmiddlehousing.com/"">missingmiddlehousing.com/</a> | <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopticosdesign.com%2F&amp;token=86ba21-1-1559851749964"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://opticosdesign.com/"">opticosdesign.com/</a> | <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planning.org%2Fcareercenter%2Fpodcast%2F&amp;token=e32ab9-1-1559851749964"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.planning.org/careercenter/podcast/"">www.planning.org/careercenter/podcast/</a></p>"

On the table during their conversation are issues the city's grappling with now, from the housing crisis and homelessness to design review and short-term rentals. John divulges the route he took to his current position — he grew up in Detroit, got plugged in to planning in Pittsburgh, and eventually made a move to the West Coast. The two unpack the phenomenon of highly visible planning leaders, the growing pains San Francisco experienced in dealing with Airbnb, and the importance of the Citywide LGBTQ+ Cultural Heritage Strategy. Through concrete examples of actions the department has taken in its work, John underscores the need for planners to experiment with the programs and policies they develop.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planning.org%2Fcareercenter%2Fpodcast%2F&amp;token=f32ace-1-1559851751807"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.planning.org/careercenter/podcast/"">www.planning.org/careercenter/podcast/</a> | <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsfplanning.org%2F&amp;token=d0a222-1-1559851751807"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://sfplanning.org/"">sfplanning.org/</a></p>"

As senior strategic policy advisor with AARP Public Policy Institute’s Livable Communities team, Jana Lynott, AICP, was responsible for its development.

Most of the focus in transportation planning has been on how we move around cars, but universal mobility as a service looks at how we can best move around people.

City manager Sadhu Johnston knows that many of its successes are due to smart, collaborative planning, such as the work the city did to get car trips to the current rate of 45 percent of all trips, down from 90 percent in the 1970s. There’s the Greenest City 2020 Action Plan, which Sadhu helped implement when he started in Vancouver; the plan seeks to set Vancouver apart as a global leader in sustainability efforts. It aims to reduce carbon emissions, add green jobs, and reverse urban tree canopy loss, among many other items.</p><p>But the city is also grappling with serious issues, such as the housing and opioid crises. Sadhu tells host Courtney Kashima, AICP, that the current average home price in Vancouver stands at $1.5 million. But the city council is taking action. Among the ground-breaking solutions they've implemented to stem the tide of rising housing costs are building modular housing — which take only three months to erect — and implementing an empty homes tax.</p><p>Courtney and Sadhu also discuss his time in Chicago, where he worked on the Chicago Climate Action Plan and helmed the Department of Environment, and before that, his time in Cleveland, where he worked with the Cleveland Green Building Coalition.</p><p>Learn more: <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planning.org%2Fcareercenter%2Fpodcast%2F&amp;token=332a9b-1-1559851756304"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.planning.org/careercenter/podcast/"">www.planning.org/careercenter/podcast/</a> | <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvancouver.ca%2F&amp;token=d8488c-1-1559851756304"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://vancouver.ca/"">vancouver.ca/</a></p>"

As a result, he’s familiar with a wide range of hazards. In the fourth episode of the APA Podcast series Resilience Roundtable, he and host Rich Roths, AICP, discuss many of them, including earthquakes, floods, landslides, and wildfires.</p><p>Pete unfortunately has a very personal experience dealing with the latter, as he and his family lost their home in October 2017 when multiple fires tore through Sonoma County, as well as Lake, Napa, Mendocino, and Solano counties. His story focuses on the Tubbs Fire, which began in Calistoga but spread into Santa Rosa, even jumping Highway 101 in the process. It destroyed the Coffey Park neighborhood and ultimately the Santa Rosa mobile home park where Pete's mother-in-law lived. (The Tubbs Fire is now the second-most destructive fire in California history after the November 2018 Camp Fire, which caused 85 deaths and destroyed 18,804 structures in Butte County.) Pete is now working as a consultant on the new multifamily development at the site of the former mobile home park.

This program's goal is to plant 2,400 trees throughout the City of Lawrence over a 3-year period. To promote the program and achieve this goal, APA-SCD worked collaboratively with Groundwork Lawrence and residents in Lawrence to conduct a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) to analyze the potential health benefits of street tree planting in the city. Throughout the project, the APA-SCD team documented their steps to ensure this process could be replicated by planners in any community around the country. The result was a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the physical, environmental, and social impacts of street tree planting in Lawrence.</p><p>Visit <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planning.org%2Fnationalcenters%2Fgreen%2F&amp;token=fee0ca-1-1559851881483"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://www.planning.org/nationalcenters/green/"">www.planning.org/nationalcenters/green/</a> to learn more about the Green Communities Center of APA's research department.</p><p>Photo by flickr user Subhash Roy: <a href=""https://gate.sc?url=https%3A%2F%2Fflic.kr%2Fp%2FNK2oLR&amp;token=78a20c-1-1559851881483"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://flic.kr/p/NK2oLR"">flic.kr/p/NK2oLR</a></p>"
