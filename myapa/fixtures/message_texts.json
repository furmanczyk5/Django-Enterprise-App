    "text": "<p>As demonstrated by the data tables, numerous factors influence compensation levels. Tabular presentation, however, quickly exhausts even a large database such as this one when the joint effects of multiple factors (e.g., experience and education and employer) are considered simultaneously.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, an additional perspective on planner compensation is offered: a Salary Worksheet based on multiple regression statistical models that attempt to reliably predict approximate salary by accounting for the joint effects of the most influential variables. &nbsp;In principle, such models allow estimation for hundreds of possible combinations of the predictors.</p>\r\n<p>Models were developed for each employment setting with sufficient responses in the tabulated sample.&nbsp; City and county planning agencies were further subdivided based on jurisdiction budget.&nbsp; Within each setting, the models include variables for experience (years in planning field), education (highest degree earned), certification by AICP, and responsibility (number supervised, whether an agency director).&nbsp; Models are based only on US respondents employed or self-employed full-time/year-round as planners.&nbsp; (Those not planners but in planning-related positions are <em>excluded</em> this year).&nbsp; The top and bottom 5% of reported salary values in each setting were censored, to increase prediction reliability.</p>\r\n<p>This worksheet reports on the eight employment settings for which models achieving reasonable levels of explanatory power and statistical significance could be constructed.&nbsp; Together, these nine settings represent 90% of all APA domestic planners.&nbsp; (Among the low-prevalence settings not modeled are federal agencies, economic development agencies, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, law firms, and development firms.)</p>\r\n<p>The models differ in their explanatory power, accounting for between 39% and 53% of the observed variations in salary. &nbsp;All models are significant by the F-test at p&lt;0.0005, and most variables are significant by the t-test at p&lt;0.05 or better.&nbsp; Each model&#39;s predictive ability varies; predictions will tend to be most accurate for salary values in the middle of the modeled range.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\r\n\t<table class=\"table\">\r\n\t\t<thead>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th>employment setting</th>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th># of cases</th>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th>modeled range</th>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th>&nbsp;</th>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th>% of variation explained</th>\r\n\t\t\t\t<th>mean predicted salary</th>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t</thead>\r\n\t\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>city planning agency (&lt;$10M budget)</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>468</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$42,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$116,400</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>47.6%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$69,830</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>city planning agency ($10-$99M)</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>1,214</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$48,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$142,180</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>46.9%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$81,300</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>city planning agency ($100M+)</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>855</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$48,250</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$160,540</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>53.2%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$83,920</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>county planning agency (&lt;$100M)</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>521</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$40,350</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$118,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>48.1%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$66,620</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>county planning agency ($100M+)</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>387</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$50,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$140,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>42.9%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$81,990</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>metropolitan or regional planning agency</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>402</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$43,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$138,970</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>53.4%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$72,380</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>state agency</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>207</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$43,250</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$112,970</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>38.6%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$70,480</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>private consulting firm</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>1,254</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$50,000</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$174,300</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>52.9%</td>\r\n\t\t\t\t<td>$84,960</td>\r\n\t\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t</tbody></table></div>\r\n<p>The statistical conclusions reached through these models must be interpreted carefully. Although a model explaining around half of the variation in salary may be described as moderately powerful, it still leaves nearly half of the variation unexplained. It is certain that other variables not captured through this survey also have an effect on salary levels: individual job performance, to note a particularly important one. To the extent the models do not include all the major determinants of compensation, they should be interpreted cautiously.</p>\r\n<p>This salary worksheet is based on statistical models developed from the APA 2018 Planners Salary Survey. Only domestic individuals employed full-time/year-round as planners, and providing complete information, were included in the analysis.</p>\r\n<p>The models provide moderately powerful predictive accuracy within relatively broad ranges, offering a rough idea of what professionals with similar characteristics and in similar situations earn, on average. Because other factors not included in the models are known to influence salary (for example, individual job performance), this worksheet is not appropriately used as an absolute guideline for any single individual&#39;s situation</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Select your responses for each variable shown, then click the CALCULATE button below to see what annual salary full-time US planners in similar circumstances earn, on average.</p>"
