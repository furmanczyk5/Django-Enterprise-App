      <strong>Introduction</strong><br/> 
      Thank you for your interest in contributing to the APA Image Library ("the Library"). The American Planning Association ("APA") values the willingness of our members to contribute to the Library. For that reason, we want you to understand the applicable rules. Before uploading an image, therefore, please read these terms of use ("Terms") carefully. If you have any questions about these Terms, please call 312-431-9100 or contact us using our <a href="/customerservice/contact-us/"><b>customer service</b></a> form. Uploading an image or clicking "I Accept" below indicates that you agree to the current version of the Terms.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:12px">
      <strong>Image Rights</strong><br/> 
      Images in the Library are available for re-use by any Library user under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License ("the CC License"), which can be read <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/legalcode"><b>here</b></a> and is summarized <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"><b>here</b></a>. By uploading an image, you represent that you own the copyright in the image (including all rights to distribute and to allow others to distribute the image under the CC License) and that use of the image in accordance with the CC License by APA and others who access the Library will not violate anyone else's rights. By uploading an image, you also grant to APA (a) the non-exclusive right to redistribute the image under the terms of the CC License and (b) the right to edit the image and any metadata associated with the image within the Library, such as any title, caption, or tagging metadata.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:12px">
      <strong>Use of Images and Right to Reject or Remove</strong><br/> 
      APA may decline to use any image submitted for inclusion in the Library. We may also remove any published image from the Library at any time and for any reason. For example, we will likely decline to use images in which a person is identifiable and images that we regard as inappropriate.  Similarly, we will likely remove published images that someone else claims to own. Any image you upload may remain in the Library and available to Library users even after you no longer are using the Library or no longer are an APA member.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:12px">
      <strong>Disclaimer of Liability</strong><br/> 
      APA shall not be liable to you for any image loss or damage that may occur through your use of the Library (including during the uploading process). By uploading or attempting to upload an image, you represent that the image content is not inappropriate, and you accept full responsibility for maintaining any personal or backup copies of the image. By uploading an image, you also accept full responsibility for any liability, loss, or damages resulting from inclusion of the image in the Library, and you agree to fully defend, indemnify, and hold harmless APA and its employees, directors, and agents in the event of a lawsuit or other legal claim arising out of use of the image.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom:12px">
      <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong><br/> 
      If you have a dispute with APA relating to the Library, you must contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute informally. Any dispute that cannot be resolved informally will be resolved by binding arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in Chicago, Illinois in accordance with the rules of the AAA.
